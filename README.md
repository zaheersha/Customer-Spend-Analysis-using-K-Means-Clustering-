# Customer-Spend-Analysis-using-K-Means-Clustering-
K-means clustering is one of the simplest and popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms.
using this Algorithm WE ARE ANALYSING THE CUSTOMER SPEND ON HIS NEEDS BASED IN HIS INCOME AS INPUT.
A cluster refers to a collection of data points aggregated together because of certain similarities.
How the K-means algorithm works ?
To process the learning data, the K-means algorithm in data mining starts with a first group of randomly selected centroids, which are used as the beginning points for every cluster, and then performs iterative (repetitive) calculations to optimize the positions of the centroids,
It halts creating and optimizing clusters when either:
The centroids have stabilized — there is no change in their values because the clustering has been successful.
The defined number of iterations has been achieved.
 

Applications of K-means Clustering
 

The concern of the fact is that the data is always complicated, mismanaged, and noisy. The conditions in the real world cast hardly the clear picture to which these types of algorithms can be applied. Let’s learn where we can implement k-means clustering among various 

 

K-means clustering is applied in the Call Detail Record (CDR) Analysis. It gives in-depth vision about customer requirements and satisfaction on the basis of call-traffic during the time of the day and demographic of a particular location.

It is used in the clustering of documents to identify the compatible documents in the same place. 

It is deployed to classify the sounds on the basis of their identical patterns and segregate malformation in them.   

It serves as the model of lossy images compression technique, in the confinement of images, K-means makes clusters pixels of an image in order to decrease the total size of it. 

It is helpful in the business sector for recognizing the portions of purchases made by customers, also to cluster movements on apps and websites.

In the field of insurance and fraud detection on the basis of prior data, it is plausible to cluster fraudulent consumers to demand based on their proximity to clusters as the patterns indicate.
